"The Lightscale Trident\n"
"As told by King Dorephan\n"
"The queen and I were blessed with\n"
"a daughter as lovely as a jewel.\n"
"We named our princess...Mipha.\n"
"To celebrate her birth, the smithy Dento\n"
"presented Mipha with a gift: a mighty\n"
"spear called the Lightscale Trident.\n"
"Mipha grew into a bright girl and soon\n"
"reached the age of receiving lessons\n"
"from the royal family's order of knights.\n"
"The whole of the royal guard adored her,\n"
"especially Sergeant Seggin, who loved\n"
"her as if she were his own kin.\n"
"Under Seggin's instruction, Mipha honed\n"
"her skills, and her radiance grew along\n"
"with her skill with the Lightscale Trident.\n"
"As a Champion, Mipha made her people\n"
"proud. However, once the Great Calamity\n"
"struck, she was never to return.\n"
"All of Zora's Domain fell into misery.\n"
"The merest thought of the princess was\n"
"enough to overcome anyone with tears.\n"
"As a way of offering her soul repose,\n"
"they tried to send the Lightscale Trident\n"
"drifting down the Zora River.\n"
"But when they did, the trident began to\n"
"glow, and Mipha's voice rang loud and\n"
"clear for all Zora to hear:\n"
"\"The Lightscale Trident and I are one...\n"
"Abandon your grief and know joy once\n"
"again. Do not cry...just remember.\"\n"
"And so, keeping to her request, on the\n"
"day of the Great Calamity...the day that\n"
"Mipha passed from this world...\n"
"the Zora venerate the Lightscale Trident\n"
"and remember their brave princess.\n"
"\n"
"Such is the origin of the\n"
"Champion Festival."

"There was a Zora princess named Ruto.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"We know that she was an attendant to\n"
"the Zora patron deity and that she was\n"
"a fair and lively girl, beloved to all.\n"
"Around that same time, an evil man with\n"
"designs on ruling the world appeared,\n"
"bringing disaster upon Zora's Domain.\n"
"It is said that Ruto then awoke as a sage,\n"
"facing this foe alongside the princess of\n"
"Hyrule and the hero of legend.\n"
"Her achievements are remembered not\n"
"only by the Zora, they are also forever\n"
"etched in the history of Hyrule.\n"
"The Divine Beast Vah Ruta, built ages\n"
"later to face off against Calamity Ganon,\n"
"was named in honor of Ruto.\n"
"That the Zora princess—my sweet\n"
"daughter Mipha—was chosen to\n"
"pilot Ruta is surely the work of fate."

"Those present that day say they saw an\n"

"The princess spoke of the Divine Beast\n"
"as she would a friend and was overjoyed\n"

"I thought nothing of it at the time,\n"

"King Dorephan Stands His Ground\n"
"\n"
"Around 100 years after King Dorephan\n"
"ascended to the throne, a stray Guardian\n"
"crossed Upland Zorana into our domain.\n"
"The Guardian seemed unstoppable.\n"
"Our best soldiers' spears barely left\n"
"a scratch on its metal hull.\n"
"It was then that our King Dorephan,\n"
"without a thought for his own safety,\n"
"came out to face the Guardian himself.\n"
"With supernatural strength, he lifted the\n"
"Guardian and hurled it into a ravine.\n"
"\n"
"The impact of the fall left the Guardian\n"
"in pieces, and it was never to trouble\n"
"another Zora ever again.\n"
"The citizens celebrated the king's valor.\n"
"From then on, their trust and respect for\n"
"him grew beyond compare.\n"
"You can still see the scar he earned\n"

"The land was also rich in ore, and so a\n"

"\n"
"What an honor it was to receive a\n"
"personal request from King Dorephan\n"
"to craft a historical stone monument!\n"
"I did not realize how much content he'd\n"
"give me, though... It certainly exceeded\n"

"I suppose I could have just shortened\n"
"the text, but it felt wrong to tamper with\n"
"our great king's words.\n"
"Thankfully, I was able to split it all\n"
"between seven monuments to ensure\n"
"that every word was preserved.\n"
"I have always prided myself on my ability\n"
"to think outside the box. I am so very\n"
"adaptable! And humble as well.\n"
"While I was at it, I thought...why not add\n"
"two of my own? And so I created one for\n"
"King Dorephan and one for Prince Sidon.\n"
"True, this is outside the scope of my\n"
"commission... But I believe their triumphs\n"
"deserve as much! But why stop at that...\n"
"Why, indeed! My achievement surely\n"
"deserves remembrance too. That is how\n"
"a commission of one became 10.\n"
"Of course, having increased the number\n"
"of monuments, I had to find places for\n"
"them all... That proved difficult.\n"
"Still, it is worth it! So long as I remember\n"
"to sign these monuments, my name will\n"
"be remembered forever. As it should be."

"The Zora River flooded every time.\n"
"The tides damaged not only our domain\n"
"but our people, washing away poor souls\n"

"The Zora king of that time, after seeking\n"

"By joining the architectural genius of the\n"

"East Reservoir Lake was swiftly built.\n"
"Thanks to this fruitful partnership,\n"

"In gratitude, the Zora king promised the\n"

"Each Zora king since has kept that oath,\n"

"Incredibly, Prince Sidon had fought his\n"

"Miracle of the White Scale\n"
"As told by King Dorephan\n"
"Our scholars say that in the distant past,\n"
"Zora's Domain had a king with no special\n"
"talent for the art of war.\n"
"What he lacked in skill with a blade,\n"
"he made up for in love for his people,\n"
"and especially love for his queen.\n"
"One day, news reached the king of a\n"
"horde of monsters gathering in the\n"
"Zodobon Highlands.\n"
"The king steeled himself for war to\n"
"protect his people, but the queen knew\n"
"how ill suited for the task he was.\n"
"Worried for his life, she wove one of her\n"
"own scales into his armor, hoping that\n"
"her love would protect him in battle.\n"
"It seemed for a time that the tide of\n"
"battle favored the Zora and that all\n"
"would make it safely home.\n"
"But the cunning Lizalfos general saw\n"
"an opening and seized it, driving the\n"
"king's forces into a corner.\n"
"Just when the general's sword was ready\n"
"to crash down upon the king, a miracle\n"
"took place.\n"
"An errant sunbeam reflected from the\n"
"scale on his armor blinded the Lizalfos,\n"
"stopping the deathblow from falling.\n"
"This was the chance the king needed to\n"
"rally his forces and turn the tide, taking\n"
"down the general and securing victory.\n"
"This came to be known as the Miracle of\n"
"the White Scale, a scale that only female\n"
"Zora possess.\n"
"It was this miracle that began the\n"
"tradition of Zora princesses crafting\n"
"armor for their future husbands."
